LiveCode Builder Lib of General MIDI Utilities

I've started this LiveCode builder library for General MIDI Utilities. Right now it just contains functions for converting some MIDI Numbers (0-127) into human readable names. I intend to expand it in the near furtue. For one thing there are no flats used for note names (although MIDI really has no flats or sharps, the frequencies produced are actually somewhere between sharp and flat, for programming convenience it was designed that way when MIDI was designed back in the 1980s).
